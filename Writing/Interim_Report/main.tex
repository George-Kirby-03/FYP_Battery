\section{Introduction}
There are curently over 7 billion people with acess to electricity \cite{chen_physics-informed_2025}, the global consuption of energy is rising by $4.5\times10^{16}$ Joules every year; 77\% of which is from
utilising non-renewable sources. With the affects of non-renwables on the environment still not fully realised, coupled with the concern of their finitie-life nature, poses a constant need to increase usage of renewable sources.
However, a large set of renwable generation methods fall under the category of veriable renewable energy (VRE) sources \cite{guo_effects_2024}, thus requring a robust form of energy storage to solve the itermitten availability -
methods of storage do exist and suitable solutions depend on the specifics and locations; as battery techonolgy increases, the use of battery as a storage medium for the energy sector are ever more increasing.  
There is also the rapid increase in elecrict vehicle production, with a push to increase the adoption of EV's, 17.3 million cars were produced in 2024 \cite{li_evolution_2024} alone with a recent 20\% average year-on
increase. Lithium Ion batterys (LIB's) are the most common currently used batterys due to their desirbale characyeristics in energy density, aging properties, cost and more.

EV's and the energy sector account now account for 90\% of the total lithium ion battery demand since 2016, the total lithium-ion battery demand is 10-times larger \cite{noauthor_executive_nodate} since 2016. Different resources predict different forcasts of total battery 
growth \cite{chinnam_fast-charging_2021,lucu_data-driven_2020}, regardless, it appears the rate of demand wil not be decreasing in the near future. 

LIB's, like all batterys and decrease in performance and capacity \cite{palacin_why_2016} until they are deemed unsuitable for their current use. This means eventually, all current batterys in use today will need to be disposed of, given that
over 660,000 tonnes of earth metals were mined in 2023 alone, a strong case for slowing down the need for mining new materials is made, whilst keeping up with the demand (cite the iea thing). It's noted that battery chemistry is still a developing feild, thus newer batteries may use less scarce materials, thus hard to
truly predict the sustaniability of mining these materials, for example, some reports (cite faraday) say cobalt supplies could be used entirley by 2040. Solutions do exits, recycling methods are been developed in order to extract the materials, termed
battery metal recycling (BMR), however there are wildly different sources suggesting how much of current batterys actually are recyled (one showing 5\%), (other showing 90\%), and the techonolgy to do so is still a devloping feild, there are many different methods (cite issurs), since most of the rare earth
elements are within the batterys cathode, methods such as hydrometallurgical process can extract these, but at the cost of severe reduction in lithum yeild (cite enji) - although there are promising methods with some proposing a lithium recovery needing less than 40\% the energy compared to mining the virgin material 
(cite enji yoo) whilst still recovering nickle and cobalt. There is also the rising interest in reusing the batterys before recyling, these batterys are ferrerd to as second-life batteries (SLB's); in the EV use-case, the majority of the batteries are deemed finished once their usable capacity drops below 80\% (cite),
but often, due to the other parameters of the batteries needing to be of high standards for EV use, the 'dead' batteries can still provide a very usefull serivce in less demanding applications, a common one being energy storage systems (ESS) \cite{mattia_lithium-ion_2025}, with claims resuing can reduce CO2 emmisions by
56\% as apposed to using natural fuel gas in situe. However there are again challanges associated, for saftey there is the need for robust testing, asorting the batteries based on their current health states, non automised methods of extracting cells from their original pack. These additional steps mean the price of SLB's 
could become at a point where they are not much cheaper than new batteries, making the solution less attractive to many sectors \cite{mattia_lithium-ion_2025}.

In summary, there are methods that are devloping to reduce the need for mining new materials and decreasing recyling emrgy, but ultimately, providing methods to increase the usable life of the current batteries serves as a direct way reduce the impacts of batteries themselves and to meet their growing demand.
If just 1 extra life cycle could be added to all EV's currently on the road (~60 million (citr)), this could power all of the UK's energy needs for one day (cite govengy); as most batterys cycle life are well over 1000, any incament in cycle life can be greatly beneficial.

Much research has been done into both modeling LIB's and optimising their usage from both an energy and aging perspective. 


What is this project? the general apprach

\subsection{Project Aims}
This project in essance aims first to characterise any battereies behaviour by perameterisation without ex-situe tests. This data will then be used in combination with work previously done to form the charging protocol based off minimising different objectve functions (the level of affects the previously proposed objective functions will be also verified by acting these tests). Data from this will be used to form the basis of a machine learning model in the hopes this model can, over time, allow for a much simpler method of predicting a batteries future behaviour.
As will be discussed in the sections below, characterising batteries behaviour can require upto nearly 30 parameters about the specific battery in order to see the affects of degredation; even then, due to minor errors in soltuons can fail to predict future properties.
\subsubsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyse ICLOCS2 and other methods in parameterising batteries during realtime use
    \item Modify previously developed charging methods for running in a lab to rest actual results
    \item See how affective adaptive methods are in the charging process as the battery ages
    \item Feed results to a data driven model to see if predicitions in battery degredation can be made
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Lithium based battery degredation modes}
\subsubsection*{Basic Background of Lithium Ion Batteries}

Lithium-ion based batteryies are favoruable largley due to the highly reducitve nature of Lithium, taking the potential relative to hydorgens reduction, lithiums half-reaction is -3.01V (cite gregg), meaning lithium can release its outershell electron relativley easy. Any cells potential difference is the diference in potentals of the negative and posoitve electrodes ( $V_t = \phi_s^+ (t) -  \phi_s^- (t)$), so having a very negative potnetial like the lithiun reduction, allows a varierty of postive electordes (where the oxidation occurs), to yeild a high battery voltage. Coupled with Lithiums low molecular weight, a high energy density cell can be achived to. The force produced by the potential difference between the electrodes drives the elctrons via the external circuit, providing useful work, allowing lithium batteries to act as an energy storage medium.


Lithium batteries all follow the the same basic pricipble of operation, as show in .... They consist of a posotive and negative elctrode, eleoctrolite a seperator and current collectors. Unlike many other battery chemistries, where the metal ions undergo chemical reactions at the electrodes which change the composition of the electrodes, lithium ions intercolate and deintercalate within the electrodes - they are in essance absorbed to and from the electrode structures (cite greg p), forming as loosley bonded lithium atoms within the elctrodes. The electrodes for the negative side is usually a grpahine based structure, allowing up to 1 lithium atom to be stored per 6 carbon atoms, whilst the posotive electrode can vary greatly between different lithium batteries; the most common posotive electrodes are often composed of transitional metal oxides such as LCO, LMO, NMC, NCA (cite Alex K Hoech et al). The lithium state in the graphine is similar to that of idividual lithium atoms, thus the elctrode potention of the negative electoride is very similar to that of pure lithium (~ -3V) (cite liquin), although its lithium storage abilities are usually lower than the porsotive electrodes. The lithium ions within the posotive electrodes are in a much lower energy state, thus their reaction potential ranges from -1 -- 2V, therefore, overall there is a large potential difference created by the want of the posotive electrode gaining electrons and the lithium ions, and the want of the lithium within the carbon of the negative electrode to give up the lithium ions and electrons (relative to each other). In general, the negative electrodes used currently are carbon based, there capcity to hold the lithium (per unit volume) is greater that the posotive electrodes used today as shown in figurexx (cite Alex), but as discussed later in this section the negative electrode is often the key limiting factor in degredation. The posotive electrode materials vary greatly in material, but since this electrode has the biggest electrode potential, it has a largest impact on the overall cell voltage, and thus energy density of the cell, in addition since per volume it holds less lithium, electrode material with higer lithium capcity will be of greater affect that improving the negative electrodes capcity. The two reactions with lithium with the battery electrodes chosen for this project are shown below (during dicharge, the reactions proceede from left to right, for the charging process, it's right to left):
\begin{align}
  \ch{LiFePO4 &<=> Li+ + e- + FePO4} \label{eq:lithium} \\
  \ch{C6 + Li+ + e- &<=> LiC6} \label{eq:sodium}
\end{align}


The electrolite is a medium in which the lithium ions can be transported via diffison to the electrodes, the electolite does not however allow electrons to flow, only via an extranl circuit can they flow, . The seperator acts as a structiral barrier to prevent the opoosite electrodes from toutching, which would allow both electrons and ions to flow, causing major fire risks from the uncotnrolled reactions. During the discharging process, a path for electrons is provided externally across the current collectors, (these collecors are not part of the reactions and are just a means to electrically connect the eleoctrolites to a usefull surface for soldering) the lithium stored within the negative electrode deintercalates, released as the posotive lithium ion, whilst the electron leaves the electrode, traveling acros the external circuit to the posotive electrode, whereby the lithium ions meet the electrons. During charging, the applied voltage at the terminals will be  above the difference of the electrode potentials, this applied overpotential causes the lithium ions within the posotive electrode to deintercalate, traveling across the electrolite to the negative electrode, where they intercalate within the graphine structure as the ions combine with electrons. The speed at which the ions flow is far slower than the electron transfer (cite greg), which contributes to the behaviour of lithium batteries.

Mention diffusion differences between charge and discharge (cite micheal j lain)

\subsubsection{Degredation methods}

\textbf{Lithium plating} - During discharge, the lithium ions intercolate into the posotive electrode. Under certain charging conditions, the lithium ions within the electrolyte will join with the electrons outside the negative electrode, producing pure lithium metal - commonly reffered to as dentrites, depicted in figure ... There is still ongoing research into finding the key causes and which factors speed up this process, but it's most understood cause is when the negative electrode (carbon in the projects battery case) potential falls below that of lithiums own potnetial (cite shichun yang + Michael.J. Lain). As previously mentioned, the lithinated carbon potnetintal is slighlty higher than that of pure lithium. From electrochemical models, the potential at the elctrodes is the sum of their open circuit potentials and their overpotential, overpotentials are caused from the dynamics of the battery, i.e during charge and discharge, thus, the overpotentials can drive the battery below that of lithium, aswell as the SoC of the battery which increases the natural potentials (cite zhiqiang). Meaning the more favourable reaction is to form lithium as apoosed to intercalate. The overpotential is largley due to the kenetic overpotential at the interface of the electrolyte, sei and electrodel; it's shown that low temperature, high currents and high SoC can cause the negative potential to drive lower (cite zhiqiang). Modelling aims to characterise and capture potentials to help with controling dendrite formation, methods from numerical electrochemical models like the p2D thing, using the butler-volmer kenetics to show key overpotentials, as well as state estimation approches for realtime - however they all require many parameters about the specific battereis.

Causes increased ageing and seftey risks, its the deposition of metallic lithoum on the anote surface, happens at high charging currents and low temperature. Since during charging, the lithium ions move , through the sei into the anode, if the ions cannot intercalate fast enough, they deposit and can become metallic lithium. Especially ehrn chargis is forces, local overpotential can causes the lithium plating, can cause dentrites

        \textbf{this is one of the main constraints for the chargings profile}
        \item Active material loss (from parts mentiones above)
        \item SEI Brakeages \\
        Charging too \textbf{high} of a temperatures causes mechanical stress on the sei layer, causing it to crack and reform, consuming more lithium ions in the process. 
        Loose sei material can also float in the electrolyte, causing further issues.
        \item Electrolyte decomposition

\subsection{Equivalent Circuit Model}
This S2352152X2400584X nicley shows the overpotential of the battery relating to the differend of the output of the battery to the equlibrium potnetial of the battery. Shown as the summation of eletrolyte opverpotential, Li concentration overportnetial, kenetic overpotential .Attempts to estimate the anode voltage based off reduced order elkectrochemical models and by use of a state estimator. In the electrocemical models, the anode potential is equal to the kenetic overpotential, anode equilibrium potential and the electolite potebtial, (cite) shows the solid-phase electrode potnetial is equal to $U_{eq} + \mu _{ct} + \Phi _{electroylite}$ th(cite). 

and resistive overpotential. This are equated witin the ecm model as the polorixing rc, and r. 
0378775313020880 bib5 gives the 

Just say, that theres models for overpotnetial which can cause the dendrite formations, these are caused by to fast ofcharge and overcharging.  dr


Polynomial fit ....
\begin{equation}
    mCp\frac{d T}{dt} = \underbrace{I^{2}R_{0} + IV_{1}}_{irreversable} - \underbrace{IT\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}}_{reversable} - \underbrace{hAT}_{dissipation}
\end{equation}



Capturing temperature models can be challegening in order to achive high accuracy, often methods of measuing temperature can have high levels of noise, alognside the thermocouples themselfs often detaching from the battereis. There is then the modeling of the batteries themself. (Talk about the irr and revs heat complications). Theres the paper explaining the irr and rev, link to electrochemical model. Then theres the paper that gives a rough value of the du/dt.
