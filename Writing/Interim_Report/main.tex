\section{Introduction}

The global consuption of energy is rising by $4.5\times10^{16}$ Joules every year; 77\% of which is from
utilising non-renewable sources. With the affects of non-renwables on the environment still not fully realised, coupled with the concern of their finitie-life nature, poses a constant need to increase usage of renewable sources.
However, a large set of renwable generation methods fall under the category of veriable renewable energy (VRE) sources \cite{guo_effects_2024}, thus requring a robust form of energy storage to solve the itermitten availability - as battery techonolgy increases, the use of battery as a storage medium for the energy sector are ever more increasing.  
There is also the rapid increase in elecrict vehicle production, with a push to increase the adoption of EV's, 17.3 million cars were produced in 2024 \cite{li_evolution_2024} alone with a recent 20\% average year-on
increase. Lithium Ion batterys (LIB's) are the most common currently used batterys due to their desirbale characyeristics in energy density, aging properties, cost and more.

EV's and the energy sector account now account for 90\% of the total lithium ion battery demand since 2016, the total lithium-ion battery demand is 10-times larger \cite{noauthor_executive_nodate} since 2016. Different resources predict different forcasts of total battery growth \cite{chinnam_fast-charging_2021,lucu_data-driven_2020}, regardless, it appears the rate of demand wil not be decreasing in the future. 

LIB's, decrease in performance and capacity \cite{palacin_why_2016} until they are deemed unsuitable for their current use. Eventually, all current batterys in use today will need to be disposed of, in 2021 436,000 tons of lithium was mined for batteries alone , a strong case for slowing down the need for mining new materials is made, whilst keeping up with the demand \cite{noauthor_battery_2023}. It's noted that battery chemistry is still a developing feild, thus newer batteries may use less scarce materials, thus hard to
truly predict the sustaniability of mining these materials, for example, some reports (cite faraday) say cobalt supplies could be used entirley by 2040. Solutions do exits, recycling methods are been developed in order to extract the materials, termed battery metal recycling (BMR), however there are wildly different sources suggesting how much of current batterys actually are recyled (one showing 5\%), (other showing 90\%), and the techonolgy to do so is still a devloping feild, there are many different methods (cite issurs), since most of the rare earth
elements are within the batterys cathode, methods such as hydrometallurgical process can extract these, but at the cost of severe reduction in lithum yeild \cite{hasan_advancing_2025} - although there are promising methods with some proposing a lithium recovery needing less than 40\% the energy compared to mining the virgin material 
\cite{yoo_life-cycle_2023} whilst still recovering nickle and cobalt. There is also the rising interest in reusing the batterys before recyling, these batterys are ferrerd to as second-life batteries (SLB's); in the EV use-case, the majority of the batteries are deemed finished once their usable capacity drops below 80\% (cite),
but often, due to the other parameters of the batteries needing to be of high standards for EV use, the 'dead' batteries can still provide a very usefull serivce in less demanding applications, a common one being energy storage systems (ESS) \cite{mattia_lithium-ion_2025}, with claims resuing can reduce CO2 emmisions by
56\% as apposed to using natural fuel gas. However there are again challanges associated, for saftey there is the need for robust testing, asorting the batteries based on their current health states, non automised methods of extracting cells from their original pack. These additional steps mean the price of SLB's could become at a point where they are not much cheaper than new batteries, making the solution less attractive to many sectors \cite{mattia_lithium-ion_2025}.

In summary, there are methods that are devloping to reduce the need for mining new materials and decreasing recyling emrgy, but ultimately, providing methods to increase the usable life of the current batteries serves as a direct way reduce the impacts of batteries themselves and to meet their growing demand.
If just 1 extra life cycle could be added to all EV's currently on the road (~60 million (citr)), this could power all of the UK's energy needs for one day (cite govengy); as most batterys cycle life are well over 1000, any incament in cycle life can be greatly beneficial.

Moddeling and prediciting how batteries degreade over time is pivitol for the growing use of lithium batteries as it allows informed descisions on how to best charge and use battereis to prolong life, as well allow optimisations on the charging throughout the batteries life.

\subsection{Project Aims}
This project aims first to characterise Lithium battereies behaviour by perameterisation, without ex-situe tests. This data will then be used in combination with work previously done to form the charging protocol based off minimising different objectve functions. Data from this will be used to form the basis of a machine learning model in the hopes this model can, over time, allow for a much simpler method of predicting a batteries future behaviour. If this model can show how different charging currents can affect degredation, a charging protocol which is derivived from minimsing such model will found and be tried in the labs to compare. If this is not achived, atleast this project can validate existing predicted charging to minimise degredaditon will be tested, and the parameterisation of the batteries during degredaditon will be researched by using optimisation tools.

Figure x highlits the original idealised goal, to have a purley data driven model that can predict the output voltage over any cycle, thus been able to derrive an idealised charging current to maxamise the lifespan.

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Lithium based battery backgrounds}


\textbf{Notice:} Throughout the research and not coming from an electrochemical background, various literature denotes the meaning of \textit{potential} and \textit{overpotential} as slighly different given the context - there is likley equivalances, but of which the author of this report cant explain. For example cite(potential for confusion) shows a clear distinction between the common $\phi$ symbol for potential as the \textit{electrical potential}, however when talking about volts measured in the real world, the \textit{potential difference} is usually the \textit{electrochemical potential difference} (specifically of electrons), for two given points denoted by $ \Delta \tilde{\mu} = \Delta\mu + \Delta zF\phi$. Overpotential in some instaces, such as the Butler-Volmer model for current exhange, is a function of overpotential $\eta$ and from G. Plett\cite{noauthor_battery_nodate} is a difference in the current \textit{electrical potential} and equlibrium potential, yet papers like \cite{appiah_unravelling_2024} show overpotential more generally as the difference between any equlibium potential and current potential. Thus confirmation should be made in regards to what type of potential and overpotential. Assumptions are given that potentials are a form of energy state, whith a difference between two points causing a force, and overpotneital as additional energy for an event to occur.


Lithium-ion batteries are favourable largely due to the highly reductive nature of lithium. Taking the potential relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), the half-reaction of metallic lithium is approximately $-3.01V$ \cite{noauthor_battery_nodate}. The cells potential difference is the diference in potentals of the negative and posoitve solid state electrodes $V_t = \phi_s^+ (t) -  \phi_s^- (t) - IR_{cc}$ where $R_{cc}$ is the current collector or tabs ohmic resistance \cite{li_lithium-ion_2021}, having a large negeative reduction potential allows for a varierty of postive electordes, yeilding a high battery voltage. Coupled with Lithiums low molecular weight, a high energy density cell can be achived too.

All lithium-ion batteries follow the same basic principle of operation. They consist of a positive electrode, a negative electrode, an electrolyte, a separator, and current collectors. Unlike many battery chemistries where active materials undergo conversion reactions that change the electrode's chemical composition, lithium-ion electrodes typically store lithium through intercalation and de-intercalation — the lithium is inserted into or extracted from \cite{noauthor_battery_nodate}. The negative electrode is usually graphite, able to store up to one lithium atom per six carbon atoms. The positive electrode can vary greatly, the most common are often composed of transitional metal oxides such as LCO, LMO, NMC, NCA \cite{koech_lithium-ion_2024}. The electrochemical state of lithium in graphite is similar to that of metallic lithium, so the negative electrode potential lies close to -3.0 V vs. SHE. Positive-electrode lithium is in a lower electrochemical energy state, giving typical reaction potentials of roughly  0-1.3 V vs. SHE, overall there is a large potential difference created. The negative electrode is often the key limiting factor in degredation as discussed later. The posotive electrode materials vary greatly in material, but since this electrode has the biggest electrode potential, it has a largest impact on the overall cell voltage, and thus energy density of the cell, in addition since per volume it holds less lithium, electrode material with higer lithium capcity will be of greater affect that improving the negative electrodes capcity. The two reactions with lithium with the battery electrodes chosen for this project are shown below (during dicharge, the reactions proceede from left to right, for the charging process, it's right to left):

\begin{align}
  \ch{LiFePO4 &<=> Li+ + e- + FePO4} \label{eq:lithium} \\
  \ch{C6 + Li+ + e- &<=> LiC6} \label{eq:sodium}
\end{align}

The electrolyte is a medium that allows lithium ions to travel between the electrodes; however, it does not allow electrons to flow, which instead travel via the external circuit. The separator acts as a structural barrier to prevent the opposite electrodes from touching, allowing only ions to pass and thus preventing uncontrolled reactions that could cause major fire risks. During the discharging process, an external electrical path is provided between the collectors. The lithium stored within the negative electrode deintercalates, releasing lithium ions into the electrolyte, while the electrons leave the negative electrode, traveling across the external circuit to the positive electrode, where the lithium ions recombine with electrons and intercalate into the positive electrode structure. During charging, the applied voltage at the terminals is above the difference of the equilibrium electrode potentials. This applied overpotential drives lithium ions to deintercalate from the positive electrode, travel across the electrolyte, and intercalate into the negative electrode, where they combine with electrons. The speed at which the ions flow is much slower than the electron transfer, which contributes to the characteristic behavior of lithium batteries \cite{noauthor_battery_nodate}.

\subsection{Lithium based battery degredation modes}

J'O. Kane et al. \cite{jokane_lithium-ion_2022} summerises the key 3 modes of degredation caused within lithium ion batteries described below. Calendar aging is neglected in this discussion. 

\textbf{Lithium plating} - Under certain charging conditions, the lithium ions within the electrolyte will join with the electrons outside the negative electrode, producing pure lithium metal - which can grow formind dentrites, depicted in figure xx. The most understood causes which acclerate this is when the negative electrode potential falls below that of lithiums own electrode potential potnetial \cite{yang_minimum_2021,lain_understanding_2021}, becoming the most thermodynamically viable reaction. From electrochemical models, the potential at the elctrodes is the sum of their open circuit potentials and overpotential. The overpotential is largley due to the kenetic overpotential at the interface of the electrodes, the Butler-Volmer equation shows as the current density $j$ increases, overpotential $\eta$. 
$$
j = a_s i_0 \left[ 
    \exp\!\left( \frac{\alpha_a F}{R T}\,\eta \right)
    - 
    \exp\!\left( -\frac{\alpha_c F}{R T}\,\eta \right)
\right]
$$

Low temperatures and high SoC also increases Lithium plating, since it becomes harder for the lithium to incercalte within the carbon, the current affects are shown in figure xx in sections below.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../Images/Lithium_Plating.png}
    \caption{Lithium deposits shown in lighter grey on the graphite electrode \cite{attia_closed-loop_2020}}
\end{figure}

\textbf{SEI Layer growth} - A layer known as solid electyroytle interphase is formed as soon as the electrolyte soulution comes into contact with the negative electrode causing salts like \ch{Li_{2}CO_{3}} to produce acids, followerd by futher reactions; this barrier acts to preven electrons further reducing and using up the more of the electrolyte, whilst allowing passage of the lithium ions to intercolate\cite{bouguern_critical_2024}. If this SEI breaks appart, new SEI will form, taking more lithium up causing a reduction of lithum avaolable for charging. Having the battery at very high and very low SoC can cause the SEI layer to thicken also \cite{agubra_analysis_2014}. Sei formation takes up electrons within its reaction, thus reducing battery capacity.

\textbf{Particle fracture} - The physical volume of the elctrodes can change during the interoclation and deintercalation, this is a degredation feature that cant be avoided in order to charge and discharge a battery, some electrodes exhibit more contraction than others, silicone is significantly greater than graphite\cite{noauthor_battery_nodate}. Concentraction gragrients, caused by high currents, within the elctrode can also cause internal stress. This can overtime cause the electrodes to break down, either resulting in more SEI grown, reducing more lithium; inability for areas of lithium intercalation, reducing charge capacity; and seperation from the binder causing either increased ohmic resistance or loss in capacity

In summary, high charging currents, extreme temperatures and extreme states of charge can accelerate degredaditon, thus to reduce this, charging and discharging at infetesimally small rates and at omptimal temperatures is best, however this neglects considdereations such as charge times, thus a balance between these constraints should always be taken into account and the charging stratagies used in this project attempts to do so. The impact on degredadtion can change between charging and discharging Mention diffusion differences between charge and discharge shown bte J. Lain \textit{et al} \cite{lain_understanding_2021}.

\subsection{Equivalent Circuit Model}

There are many ways a lithium battery can be modeled, depending on the accuracy requried, parameters avaoialable and computational power avaoialable. The two main categories are the equivalent circuit models and physics-based models \cite{noauthor_battery_nodate}. The physics-based models integrate conservation laws aswell as dynamical behaviour which leads to a set of PDE's with both scalar and gradient based boundary conditions. These require discritisation within the physical dimentions of the model to yeild a set of ODE's which can be solved for, PyBaMM is a popular framework for such modeling and its process is shwon in figure xx. Popular physics based models in order of computational complexity \cite{noauthor_choosing_nodate} are the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model \cite{noauthor_doyle_2025}, Single-Particle Model with electolyte (SPMe) and SPM. The key problems of PBM is some require over 30 parameters to fully describe the properties and errors of such can accumulate over time, and depending on accuracy needed, the discitisation can yeild hundred of ODEs (cite battery desgin).

    \end{figure}

Equivalent circuit models use standard lumped electrical elements to match the behaviour to that of a real lithium battery dynamics, it is this type of model most common in BMS systems today. T.Kalogiannis \textit{et al} \cite{kalogiannis_comparative_2019} provides common methods for obtaining the parameter values used in ECM's. The most common version is shown in figure xx, which is static in its dynamics. The key component is the $V_{oc}$ ideal voltage source, this value becomes a function, (when negleting temperature, degredaditon, charging-discharging hysterisis) of the batteries state of charge SoC, given by
$$ SoC(t) = z(t)/Q = (z(t_{0}) + \int_{t_{0}}^{t} \eta(\tau) i(\tau) \,d\tau)/Q $$ 
where $Q$ is the batteries nominal maximum capcity and $z$ is the current charge capacity. The $R_{0}$ and $R_{1}C_{1}$ branch are used to model the diffence in terminal voltage compared to that of the $V_{ocv}$ for a given instantanious SoC, and $\eta$ here is the colombic efficency, usually 0.99 for lithium batteries, since some current will be used in irreverisible chemical reactions within the cell\cite{noauthor_battery_nodate}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../Images/ECM_FO.png}
    \caption{ECM model with 1st Order Polorizing dynamics}
\end{figure}

The common state space form of this system is given below

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{v_{1}}{(t)} \\[4pt]
\dot{z}{(t)} \\[4pt]
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
- \frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}} & 0\\[4pt]
0 & 0 \\[4pt]
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
{v_{1}{(t)}} \\[4pt]
{z{(t)}} \\[4pt]
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{C_{1}}\\[4pt]
\frac{1}{Q}\\[4pt]
\end{bmatrix}
i(t)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
    V_{batt}(t) = V_{oc}(z) + i(t)R_{0} + v_{1}(t)
\end{equation}


W. Appia \textit{et al} \cite{appiah_unravelling_2024} provides the equation for the total overpotential within the battery derrived from the Fuller-Newman electrochemical mode, here, the total overpotential $\eta_{batt}$ is equal to the difference from the equlibrium battery potential $U_{batt}$ and terminal voltage potential $V_{batt}$, i.e $ V_{batt} = U_{batt} -\eta_{batt}$. This is analgous to the ECM model given above, whereby the overpotential (dynamical behaviour) is modeled by $i(t)R_{0} + v_{1}(t)$, where the equlibrium potential is $V_{oc}(z)$. 


\begin{equation}
\eta_{\text{batt}} =
\left[
\begin{aligned}
& 
\underbrace{
    \left( \Phi_{2,p}\big|_{x=L_p} - \Phi_{2,n}\big|_{x=0} \right)

    \left( U_p(c_{1,p}^s)\big|_{x=L_p} - U_p(\bar c_p)\big|_{x=L_p} \right)
    -
    \left( U_n(c_{1,n}^s)\big|_{x=0} - U_n(\bar c_n)\big|_{x=0} \right)
\right]
}_{\text{Li concentration overpotential } (\eta_1^{c})}
\\[1.2em]
&+
\underbrace{
    \left( \eta^{ct}_p\big|_{x=L_p} - \eta^{ct}_n\big|_{x=0} \right)
}_{\text{Kinetic overpotential } (\eta^{ct})}
\;-\;
\underbrace{
    R_f I_{\text{app}}
}_{\text{Electrode ohmic overpotential } (\eta_1^{\Omega})}
\end{aligned}
\right]
\end{equation}

Whilst the voltage dynamics of lithium batteries do depend on temperature, this project keeps the ambient temperature to 30, thus realtime affects on the electrical dynamics are minimal. However moddeling of the temperature is vital since temperature does directly affect degredadion. cite the thermal paper.  The irreversible is much easier to directly relate to the ecm, by basic ohms law and various levels of accuracy cant be obtained with different data avalaoable. However irreverisitbility can not be directly infered from the ecm model. Cite dodgey paper, equated it to proportional to $\partial U / \partial T$ where $U$ is the OCV and $T$ is the temperature, this value does change over the SoC of the battery and paper et all calculates the curve for a battery of similar to the test battery shown in figure x.x

\begin{equation}
    mCp\frac{d T}{dt} = \underbrace{I^{2}R_{0} + IV_{1}}_{irreversable} - \underbrace{IT\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}}_{reversable} - \underbrace{hAT}_{dissipation}
\end{equation}


A. Farman \textit{et al} \cite{farmann_study_2017}, shows that the OCV of lithium batteries can change throughout degredaditon, Lithium phosphate batteries showed a 20mV difference in regions of the SoC after aging of 500 cycles at 1C of charge and discharge. Additionally, while there exits methods of extracting an accurate OCV curve, it can take hours to accuratley obtain to minimise overpotentials \cite{kalogiannis_comparative_2019}. This is where numerical methods could be utilised to obtain the OCV curve and the other ECM parameters by fitting against a grey-box model of the dynamics, ICLOCS2 \cite{noauthor_iclocs2_nodate}, will be used heavily throughout this project to see it's ability to parameterise the battery dynamics. A.A. Mohamed \textit{et al.} \cite{mohamed_advancements_2025} cite shows the many methods to obtain ECM parameters with methods ranging from analyitcal approaches based on various current inputs, to meta-heuristic optimization algorithms.  


\subsection{Charging methods}

There exists many techniques to charge batteries with a graphical summary of the common methods shwon in figure xx, cite Qian Lin \cite{chen_overpotential_2021-1 highliths the different methods described below. The most common method is known as CC-CV charge. This is where the bulk charge is done such that the applied overportnetial to the battery causes a constant current to flow, the voltage potential of the battery rises to a defined maximum point, the charging device then switches to a contant voltage charging mode, this fixed voltage is held until the charge current decays to a negligable or fixed amount - current still flows during this stage as there is still an overpotnetial between the batteries equlibrium state and the applied constant voltage. This is the simplest to implament without the need for an accurate SoC reading to risk overcharging (like would be with pure CC charging). 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../../Matlab/Figures/CCCVProtocol.png}
    \caption{Charging segment extracted from the UoS dataset}
\end{figure}

CV is another method such that the voltage applied is the batterys maximum at full SoC, but since lithium batteries have low internal resistances, this can lead to a very high current draw at low SoC (where the equilibrium voltage is low), hence can cause accelerated degredadition, cite quan mentions 40\% capacity decrease after only 160 cycles. Boost charging provides a high current increase at low SoC, but only for breif periods and can significantly reduce degredadition rate compared to CV.

AC charging is another method which aims to minimise the frequency dependant impedance of the battery, effectivley allowing to charge the battery with a lower effective overpotentials, however as cite Qian mentiones, there are disputes on the effectivness of this method; coupled with the fact EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) is rquried to find the frequency points of interest to target, this method wont be futher reseached within the project.

Multistage CC is a popular method in reseach as it allows for the customisation of the charging throughout the cycle, this means various models can be used to optimise for a specific goal. Cite tucker for example, simulates various functions to minimise based of the ECM model provided in the section above. Electrochemical based models allows for a finer level of optimisation, such as ensuring the negative elecrode does not reach a potential to cause lithium plating, \cite{li_lithium-ion_2021} models an observer to estimate the potentials, which could be used within optimisation as one of the constraints, figure \ref{fig:OP} shows their predicited potential voltages. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../Images/Observer_op.png}
    \caption{Estimated potentials in response to charge current}
    \label{fig:OP}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../Images/common_charge_graph.jpg}
    \caption{Common charge techniques, cite qian lin towards smarter}
\end{figure}

The multistage CC charging method provides a good framework to trial different charging methods, its balance of ease of implamentation and adjustability means it is this method which will be used in the project to optimise for degredadition.

\subsection{Modelling degredation}

There are three main categorical methods to predict the degredation of lithium ion battereies: Purley data driven methods, physics-based models and a hyrbdid (phuysics informed). F. Wang \textit{et al.} \cite{wang_advanced_2025} highlitghts the advantages of the hybrid approach, stating issues and advantages with pure data-driven and pure physics model, they also present a means of categorising the common hybrid approaches. 

Papers focusing on the physics based moedeling usually focus on a subset of degredadion modes, such as SEI thickness growth cite Mixed Mode Growth Model for the Solid Electrolyte Interface. Most models start with the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model cite Dole Fuller to describe the transport of lithium within the battery (including potentials), then further sub-modules representing degredadition mechanisms are intergrated to yeild the required models. For example J. Okane \textit{et al.} \cite{jokane_lithium-ion_2022} adds SEI, Electrode cracking and loss of active material (LAM) as the the degredadion models. These approaches can model intericate parts within the battery, but require a lot of parameters about each battery under test, additionally, the discritised solutions are only ever as accurate as the models used.

Kuzhiyil \textit{et al.} \cite{kuzhiyil_lithium-ion_2025} by representing the electrochamiecal dynamics as $\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = f(\mathbf{x, z ,u}, t; \mathbf{\alpha})$ and couplining to degradation dynamics $\frac{d\mathbf{z}}{dt} = f(\mathbf{z, x ,u}, t; \mathbf{\theta})$ where $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^{m_1}$ (once discritised), representing the battery electrochemical and degredadtion state variables respecitlvey by seperation of the speed of dynamics, 

Severson \textit{et al} \cite{severson_data-driven_2019}, provides one of the largest availaible dataset for battery charging. This paper takes uses a pruley data driven apprach in modeling, but uses enginererd features such as the change in discharge voltage curves between cycle 0 and cycle 100. Using a linear regression model, they predict the cycle to failure (defined when the capacity drops to 80\% of original), it shows upto a 9.2\% accuracy. Attia \textit{et al.} \cite{attia_closed-loop_2020} takes the work of Severson \textit{et al.} to great use, using the model to predic how well differenct charge cycles last by cycling the batteries under random multistage CC cycles, predicting the degredadition and using a bayesian optmisation strategy\cite{noauthor_bayesian_nodate} to find the next appropriate charging protocol - in a closed loop feedback shown in figure \ref{fig:OptimB}

\section{Self Review}
Choosing this final year project has, and will continue to, be a big personal undertaking. I knew nothing about batteries other than the very basics when starting, I also knew very little within systems \& control other than simple LTI systems. Research has also been a struggle for me as many papers incorperate control methods or electrochemical background of which i dont have, a high amount of papers regarding the use of AI in modeling degredadtion are also behind paywalls - now more than ever on my 5th univerity year do I feel failing may well happen. I understand this document does not have indepth explinations of the use of AI within the modeling and may be vauge in the project steps, the project is very much in the sense adapting to what can be done. Work in general AI was done early in the project, I was able to learn the basics in pure nural-nets and produced a basic image classifer within pytorch but took a pause to work on other aspects of the project and univeristy modules. 

A large amount of time has been spent of narrowing down the focus of the project, as well as preparing the opmitised controll desgins for the lab testing. As of 01/12/2025, the first two batteries are undergoing characterisation tests and the softwear side is nearly done. Focus will now be spent on researching more about the machine learning and ways to optimise charging from the modeling of the battery.
