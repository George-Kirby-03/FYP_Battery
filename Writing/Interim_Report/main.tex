\section{Introduction}
There are cuurently over 7 billion people with acess to electricity \cite{chen_physics-informed_2025}, the global consuption of energy is rising by $4.5\times10^{16}$ Joules every year; 77\% of which is from utilising non-renewable sources.
With the affects of non-renwables on the environment still not fully realised, coupled wit the concern of their finitie-life nature, poses a constant need to increase usage of renewables. However, a large set of renwable generation methods
fall under the category of veriable renewable energy (VRE) sources \cite{guo_effects_2024}, thus requring a robust form of energy storage to solve the itermitten availability of these energy sources - methods of storage do exist and suitable solutions do 
depend on the specifics, as battery techonolgy increases, the use of battery in the feild are ever more increasing.  
There is also the rapid increase in elecrict vehicle production, with a push to increase the adoption of EV's, 17.3 million cars were produced in 2024 \cite{li_evolution_2024} with a recent 20\% average year-on increase. Lithium Ion batterys (LIB) are the most common batterys used in 
modern day due to their desirbale characyeristics in energy density, aging properties and more.


EV's and the energy sector account now account for 90\% of the total lithium ion battery demand since 2016, the total lithium-ion battery demand is 10-times larger \cite{guo_effects_2024} since 2016. Different resources predict different forcasts of total battery growth \cite{chinnam_fast-charging_2021,lucu_data-driven_2020},
yet it appears the rate of demand wil not be decreasing in the near future. 


LIB's as an energy storage medium age over time, and decrease untill deemed 'dead'. This means that all lIB;s currently in use will eventually be either repurposed
