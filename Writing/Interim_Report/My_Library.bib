The accuracy and complexity of the ECM, hence, are very important. State of charge (SOC) and temperature are known to affect the parameters of the ECM and have been integrated into the model effectively. However, the effect of the state of health (SOH) on these parameters has not been widely investigated. Without a good understanding of the effect of SOH on ECM parameters, parameter identification would have to be done manually through calibration, which is inefficient. In this work, experiments were performed to investigate the effect of SOH on Thevenin ECM parameters, in addition to the effect of SOC and temperature. The results indicated that with decreasing SOH, the ohmic resistance and the polarization resistance increase while the polarization capacitance decreases. An empirical model was also proposed to represent the effect of SOH, SOC, and temperature on the ECM parameters. The model was then validated experimentally, yielding good results, and found to improve the accuracy of the Thevenin model significantly.

	abstract = {A lithium-ion battery cell’s electrochemical performance can be obtained through a series of standardized experiments, and the optimal operation and monitoring is performed when a model of the Li-ions is generated and adopted. With discrete-time parameter identification processes, the electrical circuit models (ECM) of the cells are derived. Over their wide range, the dual-polarization (DP) ECM is proposed to characterize two prismatic cells with different anode electrodes. In most of the studies on battery modeling, attention is paid to the accuracy comparison of the various ECMs, usually for a certain Li-ion, whereas the parameter identification methods of the ECMs are rarely compared. Hence in this work, three different approaches are performed for a certain temperature throughout the whole SoC range of the cells for two different load profiles, suitable for light- and heavy-duty electromotive applications. Analytical equations, least-square-based methods, and heuristic algorithms used for model parameterization are compared in terms of voltage accuracy, robustness, and computational time. The influence of the ECMs’ parameter variation on the voltage root mean square error (RMSE) is assessed as well with impedance spectroscopy in terms of Ohmic, internal, and total resistance comparisons. Li-ion cells are thoroughly electrically characterized and the following conclusions are drawn: (1) All methods are suitable for the modeling, giving a good agreement with the experimental data with less than 3\% max voltage relative error and 30 mV RMSE in most cases. (2) Particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is the best trade-off in terms of computational time, accuracy, and robustness. (3) Genetic algorithm (GA) lack of computational time compared to PSO and LS (4) The internal resistance behavior, investigated for the PSO, showed a positive correlation to the voltage error, depending on the chemistry and loading profile.},

	abstract = {As lithium-ion batteries become increasingly prevalent in daily life, accurately estimating their State of Health (SOH) is crucial to reduce maintenance costs and prevent accidents. Due to the high costs of measurement, data collection, and storage, traditional data-driven methods struggle to make accurate estimations in small-sample scenarios, as they rely heavily on high-quality training data. To address this issue, we propose a method for SOH estimation that embeds physical information into a neural network. First, a semi-empirical model describing battery capacity degradation is constructed based on the Logistic equation. This model is then embedded into a neural network to form a Semi-empirical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SPINN). The loss function combines the fitting error from the neural network with the error related to physical information, ensuring that the training of SPINN is guided by physical constraints. Experiments were conducted using three publicly available datasets for small-sample training. The results show that even with limited training data, the proposed method ensures accurate SOH estimation. Furthermore, comparative experiments with existing data-driven and electrochemical models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. When trained on only 50 \% of the available data, other data-driven models exhibited prediction failures, while SPINN maintained a maximum RMSPE below 5 \%.},

	abstract = {The aging mechanisms of Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-Oxide (NMC)/Graphite lithium-ion batteries are divided into stages from the beginning-of-life (BOL) to the end-of-life (EOL) of the battery. The corresponding changes in the battery performance across these stages have been analyzed, and a digital twin model is established to quantify the primary parameters that influence these aging mechanisms. Post-mortem analysis is applied to validate the results. This paper compares the aging mechanisms from BOL to EOL using two charging protocols: a multi-step fast charge protocol and a common constant-current fast charge protocol that applies the average current of multi-step currents. Notably, a transition from a linear to a non-linear degradation trend in capacity fade is observed, beginning from a 10\% capacity reduction to EOL. From BOL to 10\% degradation, the resistance of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) grows steadily. The graphite anode’s crack depth exhibits a significant increase, accompanied by an evident collapse of cathode materials in all the test cases following a 10\% degradation until EOL. This phenomenon can be attributed to one primary reason—the expansion of the corresponding simulated resistance of charge transfer (Rct). Post-mortem analysis revealed the change in morphology, structure, and composition of various degradation conditions. This analysis proved that the primary driver of the linear aging stage is the SEI growth. Furthermore, it is evident that the transition to a non-linear aging degradation is dominated by electrode defects resulting from continuous mechanical stress during long-term aging.},

	abstract = {Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing.
In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model.
This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53\% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to thermal runaway incidents at high-temperature abuse and overcharging conditions. This study employs an experimental approach that combines an accelerating rate calorimetry with a battery testing system to investigate thermal runaway behaviors in 18,650-type LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cells at high temperatures, particularly during constant current constant voltage (CCCV) charging at rates of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C. The results reveal that cells coupled with charging behavior exhibit a greater potential for thermal runaway at high temperatures, and increased charging rates lead to increased irreversible heat and promoted side reactions, which ensure advanced thermal runaway events and enhanced heat and gas generation capacity in the cell. Furthermore, owing to the combined influences of stage of charge and the promoting effect of charging current on side reactions, the total heat and gas production and the charging rate exhibit a nonlinear relationship. Eventually, after the completion of charging, the relationship between gas generation rate and heat generation rate can be characterized by two linear growth stages. The initial stage displays consistent gas generation rates despite variations in charging rates, and the subsequent stage demonstrates different gas generation rates with increased charging rates, suggesting alterations in side reaction pathways.},

	abstract = {To reduce the carbon footprint in the transportation sector and improve overall vehicle efficiency, a large number of electric vehicles are being manufactured. This is due to the fact that environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil fuels have become significant global problems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been distinguished themselves from alternative energy storage technologies for electric vehicles (EVs) due to superior qualities like high energy and power density, extended cycle life, and low maintenance cost to a competitive price. However, there are still certain challenges to be solved, like EV fast charging, longer lifetime, and reduced weight. For fast charging, the multi-stage constant current (MSCC) charging technique is an emerging solution to improve charging efficiency, reduce temperature rise during charging, increase charging/discharging capacities, shorten charging time, and extend the cycle life. However, there are large variations in the implementation of the number of stages, stage transition criterion, and C-rate selection for each stage. This paper provides a review of these problems by compiling information from the literature. An overview of the impact of different design parameters (number of stages, stage transition, and C-rate) that the MSCC charging techniques have had on the LIB performance and cycle life is described in detail and analyzed. The impact of design parameters on lifetime, charging efficiency, charging and discharging capacity, charging speed, and rising temperature during charging is presented, and this review provides guidelines for designing advanced fast charging strategies and determining future research gaps.},

Moreover, a detailed assessment of charging strategies is performed, based on an extensive experimental study with three different cell types. The experimental results reveal that the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on cycle life can vary markedly among different lithium-ion batteries. In general, the cycle life is influenced more by high charging currents than by high discharging currents. Different boost charging protocols have disclosed that high charging currents can deteriorate cycle life not only at high state of charge (SoC), but also at very low SoC. Our investigations on pulse charging show that lithium-ion cells withstand charging pulses of high current or high voltage without any deterioration in cycle life, when the duration of the pulses remains short and the mean current and voltage values are considerably lower. For pulses of less than 1s, cycle life has been similar for pulsed and continuous charging with the same mean charging currents and identical cycle depths. This paper also presents the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on capacity utilization, charging time, and efficiency to support the development process of optimized charging protocols for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Fast charging of batteries for electric vehicles is seen as one of the most direct ways to enhance adoption. Currently, fast charging is limited by increased cell aging, which is primarily driven by Li plating and degradation of cathode materials. Here, using combined sets of experimental and computational analysis and a suite of different charge protocols, we begin to examine the interplay between failure mode, cell designs, and ultimately aging mechanisms. Slight variation in cell design and the subsequent impacts that charge protocols have on aging can create distinct cell-to-cell variation. As little as 2\% difference in porosity change at the cell negative electrode during cycling due to early Li metal plating has been found to alter the aging pathway and either accelerate or inhibit the loss due to Li plating.},

However, diverse aging mechanisms, significant device variability and dynamic operating conditions have remained major challenges. We generate a comprehensive dataset consisting of 124 commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite cells cycled under fast-charging conditions, with widely varying cycle lives ranging from 150 to 2,300 cycles. Using discharge voltage curves from early cycles yet to exhibit capacity degradation, we apply machine-learning tools to both predict and classify cells by cycle life. Our best models achieve 9.1\% test error for quantitatively predicting cycle life using the first 100 cycles (exhibiting a median increase of 0.2\% from initial capacity) and 4.9\% test error using the first 5 cycles for classifying cycle life into two groups.

	abstract = {Simultaneously optimizing many design parameters in time-consuming experiments causes bottlenecks in a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines1,2. One such example is process and control optimization for lithium-ion batteries during materials selection, cell manufacturing and operation. A typical objective is to maximize battery lifetime; however, conducting even a single experiment to evaluate lifetime can take months to years3–5. Furthermore, both large parameter spaces and high sampling variability3,6,7 necessitate a large number of experiments. Hence, the key challenge is to reduce both the number and the duration of the experiments required. Here we develop and demonstrate a machine learning methodology  to efficiently optimize a parameter space specifying the current and voltage profiles of six-step, ten-minute fast-charging protocols for maximizing battery cycle life, which can alleviate range anxiety for electric-vehicle users8,9. We combine two key elements to reduce the optimization cost: an early-prediction model5, which reduces the time per experiment by predicting the final cycle life using data from the first few cycles, and a Bayesian optimization algorithm10,11, which reduces the number of experiments by balancing exploration and exploitation to efficiently probe the parameter space of charging protocols. Using this methodology, we rapidly identify high-cycle-life charging protocols among 224 candidates in 16 days (compared with over 500 days using exhaustive search without early prediction), and subsequently validate the accuracy and efficiency of our optimization approach. Our closed-loop methodology automatically incorporates feedback from past experiments to inform future decisions and can be generalized to other applications in battery design and, more broadly, other scientific domains that involve time-intensive experiments and multi-dimensional design spaces.},

This review explores the current state, challenges, and future trajectory of lithium-ion battery technology, emphasizing its role in addressing global energy demands and advancing sustainability. Despite achieving energy densities up to 300 Wh/kg, cycle lives exceeding 2000 cycles, and fast-charging capabilities, lithium-ion batteries face significant challenges, including safety risks, resource scarcity, and environmental impacts. Recycling inefficiencies and the need for sustainable material alternatives further underscore the urgency for innovation. This paper highlights recent breakthroughs in silicon-based anodes, solid-state electrolytes, and advanced cell designs, which promise to push energy densities beyond 400 Wh/kg and extend cycle lives to over 5000 cycles. Additionally, alternative battery technologies, such as solid-state, sodium-ion, and metal-air systems, are explored for their potential to complement or surpass lithium-ion batteries in specific applications. By bridging the gap between academic research and real-world implementation, this review underscores the critical role of lithium-ion batteries in achieving decarbonization, integrating renewable energy, and enhancing grid stability. Collaborative efforts among researchers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers are essential to overcoming these challenges and driving the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy systems.},

	abstract = {The electricity sector in OECD countries is on the brink of a large shift towards low-carbon electricity generation. Power systems after 2030 may consist largely of two low-carbon generator types: Intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (IRES) such as wind and solar PV and thermal generators such as power plants with carbon capture. Combining these two types could lead to conflicts, because IRES require more flexibility from the power system, whereas thermal generators may be relatively inflexible. In this study, we quantify the impacts of large-scale IRES on the power system and its thermal generators, and we discuss how to accurately model IRES impacts on a low-carbon power system. Wind integration studies show that the impacts of wind power on present-day power systems are sizable at penetration rates of around 20\% of annual power generation: the combined reserve size increases by 8.6\% (6.3–10.8\%) of installed wind capacity, and wind power provides 16\% (5–27\%) of its capacity as firm capacity. Thermal generators are affected by a reduction in their efficiency of 4\% (0–9\%), and displacement of (mainly natural gas-fired) generators with the highest marginal costs. Of these impacts, only the increase in reserves incurs direct costs of 1–6€/MWhwind. These results are also indicative of the impacts of solar PV and wave power. A comprehensive power system model will be required to model the impacts of IRES in a low-carbon power system, which accounts for: a time step of {\textless}1h, detailed IRES production patterns, flexibility constraints of thermal generators and interconnection capacity. Ideally, an efficient reserve sizing methodology and novel flexibility technologies (i.e., high capacity interconnectors and electricity storage and DSM) will also be included.},

Fitting a reconstructed OCV curve to the OCV curve of an aged cell allows identification of degradation modes. In this study, we show that this method can also be applied to partial charging curves of a commercial cell with silicon–graphite and NMC-811 as electrode materials. Both the degradation modes and the remaining cell capacity can be determined from the reconstructed OCV curve. For the investigated cell, accurate OCV reconstruction and degradation mode estimation can be obtained from C/30 partial charging curves if the state of charge (SOC) window between 20\% and 70\% is available. We show that the method is also applicable to charging curves at higher current rates if the additional overpotential is considered by subtracting a constant voltage offset. Capacity estimation with an accuracy of 2\% of the nominal capacity is possible for current rates up to approximately C/4 if partial charging curves between 10\% and 80\% SOC are used, while a maximum current rate of C/15 should be used for accurate estimation of the degradation modes.},

	abstract = {This paper represents the evaluation of ageing parameters in lithium iron phosphate based batteries, through investigating different current rates, working temperatures and depths of discharge. From these analyses, one can derive the impact of the working temperature on the battery performances over its lifetime. At elevated temperature (40°C), the performances are less compared to at 25°C. The obtained mathematical expression of the cycle life as function of the operating temperature reveals that the well-known Arrhenius law cannot be applied to derive the battery lifetime from one temperature to another. Moreover, a number of cycle life tests have been performed to illustrate the long-term capabilities of the proposed battery cells at different discharge constant current rates. The results reveal the harmful impact of high current rates on battery characteristics. On the other hand, the cycle life test at different depth of discharge levels indicates that the battery is able to perform 3221 cycles (till 80\% DoD) compared to 34,957 shallow cycles (till 20\% DoD). To investigate the cycle life capabilities of lithium iron phosphate based battery cells during fast charging, cycle life tests have been carried out at different constant charge current rates. The experimental analysis indicates that the cycle life of the battery degrades the more the charge current rate increases. From this analysis, one can conclude that the studied lithium iron based battery cells are not recommended to be charged at high current rates. This phenomenon affects the viability of ultra-fast charging systems. Finally, a cycle life model has been developed, which is able to predict the battery cycleability accurately.},

Lithium-ion batteries are found to be suitable for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and pure electric vehicles (EVs), and temperature control on lithium batteries is vital for long-term performance and durability. Unfortunately, battery thermal management (BTM) has not been paid close attention partly due to poor understanding of battery thermal behaviour. Cell performance change dramatically with temperature, but it improves with temperature if a suitable operating temperature window is sustained. This paper provides a review on two aspects that are battery thermal model development and thermal management strategies. Thermal effects of lithium-ion batteries in terms of thermal runaway and response under cold temperatures will be studied, and heat generation methods are discussed with aim of performing accurate battery thermal analysis. In addition, current BTM strategies utilised by automotive suppliers will be reviewed to identify the imposing challenges and critical gaps between research and practice. Optimising existing BTMs and exploring new technologies to mitigate battery thermal impacts are required, and efforts in prioritising BTM should be made to improve the temperature uniformity across the battery pack, prolong battery lifespan, and enhance the safety of large packs.},

	abstract = {Battery preheating at low temperatures is essential to ensure the efficient operation of electric vehicles in all climate conditions. Alternating current heating is proposed as an effective preheating method to improve the poor performance of lithium-ion batteries operated at low temperatures. To describe the dynamic voltage behavior accurately, the Butler-Volmer equation has been employed, and then a novel electro-thermal coupled model has been proposed for accurately calculating the thermal behavior of a battery. To obtain the optimal preheating performance, the electro-thermal coupled model-based available heating current computational method has been developed to obtain the optimal echelon preheating strategy. This method has the potential to balance the heat generation rate and degradation on battery lifetime. Finally, the proposed echelon heating strategy has been verified by battery cells and battery packs. Results show that the battery cell can be heated from the temperature of −20.3 °C to 10.02 °C by 13.7 min with an average temperature-rise 2.21 °C/min. And the battery pack can be heated from −20.84 °C to 10 °C by 12.4 min with an average temperature-rise is 2.47 °C/min.},

Performances of battery charging directly affect consumers' recognition and acceptability of electric vehicles. Study on optimized charging methods is vital for future development of a smarter battery management system and an intelligent electric vehicle.

It demonstrates that the optimized charging methods can reduce charging time, improve charging performance and extend battery life cycle comparing with conventional charging methods. At the end, this paper also provides a four-step pathway towards the design of an optimal charging method of Li-ion batteries: determine optimization objectives, establish optimization scheme, develop matching design and implement and promote the optimal charging method.},

	abstract = {Demand for critical materials (nickel, cobalt, manganese [NCM], and lithium) for use in batteries is increasing rapidly due to the expansion of the battery-electric vehicles market. Battery metal recycling (BMR) is an important technology that can potentially realize environmental and economic benefits in cathode active material (LiNixMnyCozO2) production using recycled materials. While current major battery recycling technologies recover cathode materials (NCM) and other metals (steel, aluminum, copper, etc.) from the spent battery, the lithium (Li) recovery rate is less than 1\% in the world. In this study, we analyze the environmental benefits of a BMR process that recovers lithium in the form of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH∙H2O) along with other cathode materials. Using life-cycle analysis (LCA), we evaluate the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, criteria air pollutant emissions, and water consumption of the new BMR technology in terms of lithium hydroxide production and cathode active material production. The LCA results show that the life-cycle GHG emissions recycled LiOH are 37–72\% lower than those of virgin LiOH production from Chilean brine and Australian ore, respectively. In addition, the life-cycle GHG emissions of NCM811 produced using the recycled materials are 40–48\% lower compared to virgin cathode active material production. Furthermore, recovering lithium from the spent batteries reduces associated air pollutant emissions and water consumption relative to using the virgin materials or materials from other recycling technologies without LiOH recovery.},

	abstract = {, Concerted efforts by stakeholders could overcome the hurdles and enable a viable recycling system for automotive LIBs by the time many of them go out of service.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were commercialized in the early 1990s and gained popularity first in consumer electronics, then more recently for electric vehicle (EV) propulsion, because of their high energy and power density and long cycle life. Their rapid adoption brings with it the challenge of end-of-life waste management. There are strong arguments for LIB recycling from environmental sustainability, economic, and political perspectives. Recycling reduces material going into landfills and avoids the impacts of virgin material production. LIBs contain high-value materials like cobalt and nickel, so recycling can reduce material and disposal costs, leading to reduced EV costs. Battery recycling can also reduce material demand and dependence on foreign resources, such as cobalt from Democratic Republic of the Congo, where much production relies on armed aggression and child labor.Several companies are finding ways to commercialize recycling of the increasingly diverse LIB waste stream. Although Pb-acid battery recycling has been successfully implemented, there are many reasons why recycling of LIBs is not yet a universally well-established practice. Some of these are technical constraints, and others involve economic barriers, logistic issues, and regulatory gaps. This paper first builds a case as to why LIBs should be recycled, next compares recycling processes, and then addresses the different factors affecting LIB recycling to direct future work towards overcoming the barriers so that recycling can become standard practice.},

Fitting a reconstructed OCV curve to the OCV curve of an aged cell allows identification of degradation modes. In this study, we show that this method can also be applied to partial charging curves of a commercial cell with silicon–graphite and NMC-811 as electrode materials. Both the degradation modes and the remaining cell capacity can be determined from the reconstructed OCV curve. For the investigated cell, accurate OCV reconstruction and degradation mode estimation can be obtained from C/30 partial charging curves if the state of charge (SOC) window between 20\% and 70\% is available. We show that the method is also applicable to charging curves at higher current rates if the additional overpotential is considered by subtracting a constant voltage offset. Capacity estimation with an accuracy of 2\% of the nominal capacity is possible for current rates up to approximately C/4 if partial charging curves between 10\% and 80\% SOC are used, while a maximum current rate of C/15 should be used for accurate estimation of the degradation modes.},

In this work, a novel method is developed based on the quasi-steady state heat transfer analysis to determine the thermal conductivity and the specific heat simultaneously. Both prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells and pouch cells with different electrode materials are used in this experimental test. A constant heat flux is applied to the cell surface whereas the heat loss is estimated based upon the temperature drop curve. As such, the quasi-steady state heat transfer can be attained to determine cell thermal parameters. It is observed that cell thermal parameters increase linearly with the increase of the operating temperature. Furthermore, the operating temperature has a more significant influence on the cell specific heat than the thermal conductivity, while the effect of the state of charge has a minimal effect on these two parameters. The current method demonstrates an effective and practical way to determine the thermal conductivity and specific heat of the cell simultaneously.},

In particular, we not only provide detailed information and access addresses for each dataset, but also present, four innovative methods for battery aging health factor extraction. These methods, based on advanced AI techniques, are able to effectively identify and quantify key indicators of battery performance degradation, thereby enhancing the precision and dependability of RUL prediction. Additionally, the article identifies major challenges faced by current predictive techniques, including data quality, model generalization capabilities, and computational cost, highlighting the need for research focused on dataset diversity, multiple algorithm fusion, and hybrid physical-data-driven models to enhance prediction accuracy.

This review article offers insights into key elements—lithium, nickel, manganese, cobalt, and aluminium—within modern battery technology, focusing on their roles and significance in Li-ion batteries. The review paper delves into the materials comprising a Li-ion battery cell, including the cathode, anode, current concentrators, binders, additives, electrolyte, separator, and cell casing, elucidating their roles and characteristics. Additionally, it examines various cathode materials crucial to the performance and safety of Li-ion batteries, such as spinels, lithium metal oxides, and olivines, presenting their distinct advantages and challenges for battery applications. Lithium manganese (Li-Mn-O) spinels, like LiMn2O4, offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option with good thermal stability despite challenges such as capacity fading, which necessitate innovative approaches like dual-doping strategies. Nickel-rich lithium metal oxides like LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 provide high specific energy but face/encounter issues with cobalt reliance and stability, prompting research to reduce cobalt content and increase nickel content. Olivine-based cathode materials, such as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), prioritize safety and stability but exhibit lower energy density, leading to exploration into isomorphous substitutions and nanostructuring to enhance performance. Safety considerations, including thermal management and rigorous testing protocols, are essential to mitigate risks of thermal runaway and short circuits. Thus, this review scrutinizes recent advancements in Li-ion battery cathode materials, delving into strategies aimed at mitigating associated drawbacks and identifying suitable electrode materials based on their electrochemical performance and capacity during operation.},

	abstract = {The overpotential of Li-ion batteries is one of the most relevant characteristics influencing the power and energy densities of these battery systems. However, the intrinsic complexity and multi-influencing factors make it challenging to analyze the overpotential precisely. To decompose the total overpotential of a battery into various individual components, a pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model has been adopted and used for electrochemical simulations of a graphite-based porous electrode/Li battery. Analytical expressions for the total overpotential have been mathematically derived and split up into four terms, associated with the electrolyte concentration overpotential, the Li concentration overpotential in the solid, the kinetic overpotential, and the ohmic overpotential. All these four terms have been separately analyzed and are found to be strongly dependent on the physical/chemical battery parameters and the reaction-rate distribution inside the porous electrode. The reaction-rate distribution of the porous electrode is generally non-uniform and shows dynamic changes during (dis)charging, resulting in fluctuations in the four overpotential components. In addition, the disappearance of the phase-change information in the voltage curve of the graphite-based porous electrode/Li battery under moderate and high C-rates is ascribed to the Li concentration overpotential among solid particles, resulting from the non-uniform reaction-rate distribution.},

However, dynamic operating conditions and complicated ageing mechanisms create challenges in determining the major sources of these overpotentials. We estimate the overpotentials of cells in a dataset consisting of aged and non-aged commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite cells cycled under fast charging conditions. Using the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model and the discharge profiles of the first 630 cycles, we conducted an in-situ monitoring of the sources of the overpotentials of cells that exhibited the longest, median, and shortest end of life. A derived analytical expression is used to decompose the total overpotential into lithium concentration overpotential, electrolyte concentration overpotential, ohmic overpotential and kinetic overpotential. The major source of overpotential is from the loss of lithium inventory and loss of active materials during cycling.

	abstract = {A physics-based equivalent circuit model (ECM) is derived by applying finite volume method to a pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Only standard passive components are used to construct the equivalent circuit, which reflects the fact that a Li-ion battery is an energy storage device. Voltages across and currents through the circuit elements in the ECM are identified with the respective internal electrochemical processes in the battery, thus allowing the parametric values of circuit elements to be expressed as functions of the Li-ion concentrations and temperature. Variations in the parametric values across the thickness of the battery leads to a distributed-parameter ECM amenable for wide range of applications. Furthermore, in contrast to existing reduced-order models of Li-ion battery which are described by differential algebraic equations, the ECM is governed by ordinary different equations wherein all the circuit components are expressed as explicit functions of the state and input variables. Hence, the developed model allows solution to be found directly using matrix algebra, resulting in rapid simulation study suitable for the development of computationally-efficient real-time battery control algorithm. Results of simulation based on the developed distributed-parameter ECM show close agreement with those obtained from a partial differential equation based P2D model under wide range of applied current rate, but at a much reduced computational burden.},

	abstract = {As demands for massive energy consumption inevitably grow, lithium-ion batteries have been widely recognized as promising energy devices and fundamental components for electric vehicles or grid application. However, certain circuit configuration especially parallel connection exhibits highly heterogeneous current distributions in different branches, some of which undertakes considerable current fluctuation during charge/discharge. Therefore, a charging strategy for integrated energy storage facilities is highly desirable to avoid the side reactions like lithium plating that can cause severe degradation or even risks of thermal runaway. In this study, a parallel-module model is established based on a modified single particle model with side reactions, and experimentally validated under various C-rates. Then a minimum Li plating overpotential control (MLPOC) based charging strategy is proposed for this parallel-module model and effectiveness for reducing capacity loss is verified by module simulations under high C-rate charging. Furthermore, parameter sensitivity of resistance ratio between branch and interconnect resistances on module performance with or without MLPOC are investigated. Results show that a medium resistance ratio of 20–30 is recommended for this parallel module. The insights from this paper not only provide charging strategy with minor degradation but also guide the design of battery module for better pack charging performance.},

	abstract = {The fast charging of Lithium-ion batteries within electric vehicles can accelerate the side reaction of lithium plating due to an anode potential that occurs as state of charge increases. It is important to monitor the anode potential during battery charging, but it is not practical to measure the inside of the battery directly for a commercial cell. This paper proposes an observer for estimating the cathode and anode potentials based on the reduced-order electrochemical model, which only needs terminal voltage to track the cathode and anode potentials and their internal charge concentration. The observer design is based on the model order reduction and linearisation of a single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe) to achieve acceptable accuracy with a low calculation cost. The linearised model and the designed observer are validated by the experimental results of a three-electrode cell. The results show that the linearised model reduces the operation time by more than 99\% compared with the full-order SPMe model using the same processor. The results also verify that the root mean square error of the cathode and anode potential estimated by the observer is less than 0.02 V for a charging current range from 0.3C to 1C. This shows that the developed cathode and anode potential observer based on the reduced-order electrochemical model can be used within real-time control applications to detect the anode potential in real time to avoid battery degradation caused by lithium plating.},

	abstract = {Highly accurate measurements of the entropic coefficient of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) over a wide state-of-charge (SoC) range are essential for optimizing the thermal management systems used to maintain battery temperature within an appropriate level, and thereby limit the aging process and avoid thermal runaway, which can lead to fire or explosions. This is usually accomplished by the potentiometric method. However, the high time consumption of this method greatly limits its usefulness in commercial settings. The present work addresses this issue by proposing a fast and precise method to determine the entropic coefficients of LIBs based on frequency-domain analysis employing a standard square wave current with a DC offset as input. The entropic coefficient is then obtained at each SoC level through Fourier transform according to the magnitudes of the fundamental frequency components of the heat generation rate and current. The measurement error introduced by the DC offset and internal resistance is analyzed in this paper. The continuous entropic coefficient profile of a commercial LiFePO4/Graphite prismatic cell is measured and the results are compared with those obtained from the potentiometric method. The analysis demonstrates that employing the average of the entropic coefficient profiles obtained under charging and discharging conditions is an effective means of eliminating the error introduced by the DC offset current and the effect of hysteresis. As a result, the proposed method not only obtains a continuous entropic coefficient profile that agrees well with the discrete values obtained using the potentiometric method, but does so in 1/10 of the time. Hence, the proposed method has the potential for use in on-board battery diagnostics applications.},

This layer forms on the anode during initial charging to avoid ongoing electrolyte decomposition and stabilize the anode-electrolyte interface. However, repeated charging and discharging can destabilize the SEI, thereby increasing internal resistance and reducing capacity. Similarly, the Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) layer is crucial for the performance, safety, and durability of LIBs. The formation, stability, and evolution of the SEI and CEI layers are critical for the efficiency and lifespan of LIBs. Research has focused on optimizing these interphases through advanced materials, interface modifications, and improved electrolyte formulations. Enhancing our understanding of SEI and CEI formation and degradation can lead to significant advancements in LIB performance, lifespan, and safety, thereby satisfying the demands for high-performance power storage in electronic appliances and electric vehicles.

	abstract = {The breakdown of the protective solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formed on lithium ion battery anodes can initiate further electrolyte decomposition and the formation of non-uniform and electronically insulating reaction products on the surface of the graphite particles. The results from this study indicate that raising both the lower and upper ends of the state of charge (SOC) increased the rate of the electrolyte decomposition side reaction to form a thick deposit surface film. This deposit layer contained lithium that can no longer participate in the reversible electrochemical reaction. In addition, the high cycling potential coupled with high charge rate created a large lithium concentration gradient that led to some particles detachment from the current collector and isolation in the electrochemical process.},
