Currently, fast charging is limited by increased cell aging, which is primarily driven by Li plating and degradation of cathode materials. Here, using combined sets of experimental and computational analysis and a suite of different charge protocols, we begin to examine the interplay between failure mode, cell designs, and ultimately aging mechanisms. Slight variation in cell design and the subsequent impacts that charge protocols have on aging can create distinct cell-to-cell variation. As little as 2\% difference in porosity change at the cell negative electrode during cycling due to early Li metal plating has been found to alter the aging pathway and either accelerate or inhibit the loss due to Li plating.},

Moreover, a detailed assessment of charging strategies is performed, based on an extensive experimental study with three different cell types. The experimental results reveal that the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on cycle life can vary markedly among different lithium-ion batteries. In general, the cycle life is influenced more by high charging currents than by high discharging currents. Different boost charging protocols have disclosed that high charging currents can deteriorate cycle life not only at high state of charge (SoC), but also at very low SoC. Our investigations on pulse charging show that lithium-ion cells withstand charging pulses of high current or high voltage without any deterioration in cycle life, when the duration of the pulses remains short and the mean current and voltage values are considerably lower. For pulses of less than 1s, cycle life has been similar for pulsed and continuous charging with the same mean charging currents and identical cycle depths. This paper also presents the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on capacity utilization, charging time, and efficiency to support the development process of optimized charging protocols for practical applications.},

	abstract = {To reduce the carbon footprint in the transportation sector and improve overall vehicle efficiency, a large number of electric vehicles are being manufactured. This is due to the fact that environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil fuels have become significant global problems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been distinguished themselves from alternative energy storage technologies for electric vehicles (EVs) due to superior qualities like high energy and power density, extended cycle life, and low maintenance cost to a competitive price. However, there are still certain challenges to be solved, like EV fast charging, longer lifetime, and reduced weight. For fast charging, the multi-stage constant current (MSCC) charging technique is an emerging solution to improve charging efficiency, reduce temperature rise during charging, increase charging/discharging capacities, shorten charging time, and extend the cycle life. However, there are large variations in the implementation of the number of stages, stage transition criterion, and C-rate selection for each stage. This paper provides a review of these problems by compiling information from the literature. An overview of the impact of different design parameters (number of stages, stage transition, and C-rate) that the MSCC charging techniques have had on the LIB performance and cycle life is described in detail and analyzed. The impact of design parameters on lifetime, charging efficiency, charging and discharging capacity, charging speed, and rising temperature during charging is presented, and this review provides guidelines for designing advanced fast charging strategies and determining future research gaps.},

The model consists of two sub-models, an equivalent-circuit electrical model and a two-state thermal model which are coupled through heat generation and temperature dependence of the electrical parameters. The computationally efficient 5-state model captures the state of charge (SOC), terminal voltage, surface temperature and the often neglected core temperature of a battery for wide range of operating conditions. The proposed parameterization scheme allows separate identification of the electric and thermal sub-models, greatly reducing the complexity of the parameterization process. The methodology is applied to a LiFePO4/graphite battery. Comparison with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data clarifies the frequency range of the model fidelity. The model is further validated with two drive-cycle tests, covering SOC range 25\%–100\%, temperature 5 °C–38 °C, and maximum C-rate of 22C.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to thermal runaway incidents at high-temperature abuse and overcharging conditions. This study employs an experimental approach that combines an accelerating rate calorimetry with a battery testing system to investigate thermal runaway behaviors in 18,650-type LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cells at high temperatures, particularly during constant current constant voltage (CCCV) charging at rates of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C. The results reveal that cells coupled with charging behavior exhibit a greater potential for thermal runaway at high temperatures, and increased charging rates lead to increased irreversible heat and promoted side reactions, which ensure advanced thermal runaway events and enhanced heat and gas generation capacity in the cell. Furthermore, owing to the combined influences of stage of charge and the promoting effect of charging current on side reactions, the total heat and gas production and the charging rate exhibit a nonlinear relationship. Eventually, after the completion of charging, the relationship between gas generation rate and heat generation rate can be characterized by two linear growth stages. The initial stage displays consistent gas generation rates despite variations in charging rates, and the subsequent stage demonstrates different gas generation rates with increased charging rates, suggesting alterations in side reaction pathways.},

	abstract = {Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing.
In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model.
This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53\% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.},

	abstract = {The aging mechanisms of Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-Oxide (NMC)/Graphite lithium-ion batteries are divided into stages from the beginning-of-life (BOL) to the end-of-life (EOL) of the battery. The corresponding changes in the battery performance across these stages have been analyzed, and a digital twin model is established to quantify the primary parameters that influence these aging mechanisms. Post-mortem analysis is applied to validate the results. This paper compares the aging mechanisms from BOL to EOL using two charging protocols: a multi-step fast charge protocol and a common constant-current fast charge protocol that applies the average current of multi-step currents. Notably, a transition from a linear to a non-linear degradation trend in capacity fade is observed, beginning from a 10\% capacity reduction to EOL. From BOL to 10\% degradation, the resistance of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) grows steadily. The graphite anode’s crack depth exhibits a significant increase, accompanied by an evident collapse of cathode materials in all the test cases following a 10\% degradation until EOL. This phenomenon can be attributed to one primary reason—the expansion of the corresponding simulated resistance of charge transfer (Rct). Post-mortem analysis revealed the change in morphology, structure, and composition of various degradation conditions. This analysis proved that the primary driver of the linear aging stage is the SEI growth. Furthermore, it is evident that the transition to a non-linear aging degradation is dominated by electrode defects resulting from continuous mechanical stress during long-term aging.},

	abstract = {As lithium-ion batteries become increasingly prevalent in daily life, accurately estimating their State of Health (SOH) is crucial to reduce maintenance costs and prevent accidents. Due to the high costs of measurement, data collection, and storage, traditional data-driven methods struggle to make accurate estimations in small-sample scenarios, as they rely heavily on high-quality training data. To address this issue, we propose a method for SOH estimation that embeds physical information into a neural network. First, a semi-empirical model describing battery capacity degradation is constructed based on the Logistic equation. This model is then embedded into a neural network to form a Semi-empirical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SPINN). The loss function combines the fitting error from the neural network with the error related to physical information, ensuring that the training of SPINN is guided by physical constraints. Experiments were conducted using three publicly available datasets for small-sample training. The results show that even with limited training data, the proposed method ensures accurate SOH estimation. Furthermore, comparative experiments with existing data-driven and electrochemical models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. When trained on only 50 \% of the available data, other data-driven models exhibited prediction failures, while SPINN maintained a maximum RMSPE below 5 \%.},

The accuracy and complexity of the ECM, hence, are very important.

However, the effect of the state of health (SOH) on these parameters has not been widely investigated. Without a good understanding of the effect of SOH on ECM parameters, parameter identification would have to be done manually through calibration, which is inefficient. In this work, experiments were performed to investigate the effect of SOH on Thevenin ECM parameters, in addition to the effect of SOC and temperature. The results indicated that with decreasing SOH, the ohmic resistance and the polarization resistance increase while the polarization capacitance decreases. An empirical model was also proposed to represent the effect of SOH, SOC, and temperature on the ECM parameters. The model was then validated experimentally, yielding good results, and found to improve the accuracy of the Thevenin model significantly. With low complexity and high accuracy, this model can be easily integrated into real-world BMS applications.},

	abstract = {A lithium-ion battery cell’s electrochemical performance can be obtained through a series of standardized experiments, and the optimal operation and monitoring is performed when a model of the Li-ions is generated and adopted. With discrete-time parameter identification processes, the electrical circuit models (ECM) of the cells are derived. Over their wide range, the dual-polarization (DP) ECM is proposed to characterize two prismatic cells with different anode electrodes. In most of the studies on battery modeling, attention is paid to the accuracy comparison of the various ECMs, usually for a certain Li-ion, whereas the parameter identification methods of the ECMs are rarely compared. Hence in this work, three different approaches are performed for a certain temperature throughout the whole SoC range of the cells for two different load profiles, suitable for light- and heavy-duty electromotive applications. Analytical equations, least-square-based methods, and heuristic algorithms used for model parameterization are compared in terms of voltage accuracy, robustness, and computational time. The influence of the ECMs’ parameter variation on the voltage root mean square error (RMSE) is assessed as well with impedance spectroscopy in terms of Ohmic, internal, and total resistance comparisons. Li-ion cells are thoroughly electrically characterized and the following conclusions are drawn: (1) All methods are suitable for the modeling, giving a good agreement with the experimental data with less than 3\% max voltage relative error and 30 mV RMSE in most cases. (2) Particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is the best trade-off in terms of computational time, accuracy, and robustness. (3) Genetic algorithm (GA) lack of computational time compared to PSO and LS (4) The internal resistance behavior, investigated for the PSO, showed a positive correlation to the voltage error, depending on the chemistry and loading profile.},

	abstract = {The equivalent circuit model (ECM) is a battery model often used in the battery management system (BMS) to monitor and control lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The accuracy and complexity of the ECM, hence, are very important. State of charge (SOC) and temperature are known to affect the parameters of the ECM and have been integrated into the model effectively. However, the effect of the state of health (SOH) on these parameters has not been widely investigated. Without a good understanding of the effect of SOH on ECM parameters, parameter identification would have to be done manually through calibration, which is inefficient. In this work, experiments were performed to investigate the effect of SOH on Thevenin ECM parameters, in addition to the effect of SOC and temperature. The results indicated that with decreasing SOH, the ohmic resistance and the polarization resistance increase while the polarization capacitance decreases. An empirical model was also proposed to represent the effect of SOH, SOC, and temperature on the ECM parameters. The model was then validated experimentally, yielding good results, and found to improve the accuracy of the Thevenin model significantly. With low complexity and high accuracy, this model can be easily integrated into real-world BMS applications.},

	abstract = {Simultaneously optimizing many design parameters in time-consuming experiments causes bottlenecks in a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines1,2. One such example is process and control optimization for lithium-ion batteries during materials selection, cell manufacturing and operation. A typical objective is to maximize battery lifetime; however, conducting even a single experiment to evaluate lifetime can take months to years3–5. Furthermore, both large parameter spaces and high sampling variability3,6,7 necessitate a large number of experiments. Hence, the key challenge is to reduce both the number and the duration of the experiments required. Here we develop and demonstrate a machine learning methodology  to efficiently optimize a parameter space specifying the current and voltage profiles of six-step, ten-minute fast-charging protocols for maximizing battery cycle life, which can alleviate range anxiety for electric-vehicle users8,9. We combine two key elements to reduce the optimization cost: an early-prediction model5, which reduces the time per experiment by predicting the final cycle life using data from the first few cycles, and a Bayesian optimization algorithm10,11, which reduces the number of experiments by balancing exploration and exploitation to efficiently probe the parameter space of charging protocols. Using this methodology, we rapidly identify high-cycle-life charging protocols among 224 candidates in 16 days (compared with over 500 days using exhaustive search without early prediction), and subsequently validate the accuracy and efficiency of our optimization approach. Our closed-loop methodology automatically incorporates feedback from past experiments to inform future decisions and can be generalized to other applications in battery design and, more broadly, other scientific domains that involve time-intensive experiments and multi-dimensional design spaces.},

We generate a comprehensive dataset consisting of 124 commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite cells cycled under fast-charging conditions, with widely varying cycle lives ranging from 150 to 2,300 cycles. Using discharge voltage curves from early cycles yet to exhibit capacity degradation, we apply machine-learning tools to both predict and classify cells by cycle life. Our best models achieve 9.1\% test error for quantitatively predicting cycle life using the first 100 cycles (exhibiting a median increase of 0.2\% from initial capacity) and 4.9\% test error using the first 5 cycles for classifying cycle life into two groups.

	abstract = {The electricity sector in OECD countries is on the brink of a large shift towards low-carbon electricity generation. Power systems after 2030 may consist largely of two low-carbon generator types: Intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (IRES) such as wind and solar PV and thermal generators such as power plants with carbon capture. Combining these two types could lead to conflicts, because IRES require more flexibility from the power system, whereas thermal generators may be relatively inflexible. In this study, we quantify the impacts of large-scale IRES on the power system and its thermal generators, and we discuss how to accurately model IRES impacts on a low-carbon power system. Wind integration studies show that the impacts of wind power on present-day power systems are sizable at penetration rates of around 20\% of annual power generation: the combined reserve size increases by 8.6\% (6.3–10.8\%) of installed wind capacity, and wind power provides 16\% (5–27\%) of its capacity as firm capacity. Thermal generators are affected by a reduction in their efficiency of 4\% (0–9\%), and displacement of (mainly natural gas-fired) generators with the highest marginal costs. Of these impacts, only the increase in reserves incurs direct costs of 1–6€/MWhwind. These results are also indicative of the impacts of solar PV and wave power. A comprehensive power system model will be required to model the impacts of IRES in a low-carbon power system, which accounts for: a time step of {\textless}1h, detailed IRES production patterns, flexibility constraints of thermal generators and interconnection capacity. Ideally, an efficient reserve sizing methodology and novel flexibility technologies (i.e., high capacity interconnectors and electricity storage and DSM) will also be included.},

This review explores the current state, challenges, and future trajectory of lithium-ion battery technology, emphasizing its role in addressing global energy demands and advancing sustainability. Despite achieving energy densities up to 300 Wh/kg, cycle lives exceeding 2000 cycles, and fast-charging capabilities, lithium-ion batteries face significant challenges, including safety risks, resource scarcity, and environmental impacts. Recycling inefficiencies and the need for sustainable material alternatives further underscore the urgency for innovation. This paper highlights recent breakthroughs in silicon-based anodes, solid-state electrolytes, and advanced cell designs, which promise to push energy densities beyond 400 Wh/kg and extend cycle lives to over 5000 cycles. Additionally, alternative battery technologies, such as solid-state, sodium-ion, and metal-air systems, are explored for their potential to complement or surpass lithium-ion batteries in specific applications. By bridging the gap between academic research and real-world implementation, this review underscores the critical role of lithium-ion batteries in achieving decarbonization, integrating renewable energy, and enhancing grid stability. Collaborative efforts among researchers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers are essential to overcoming these challenges and driving the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy systems.},

Fitting a reconstructed OCV curve to the OCV curve of an aged cell allows identification of degradation modes. In this study, we show that this method can also be applied to partial charging curves of a commercial cell with silicon–graphite and NMC-811 as electrode materials. Both the degradation modes and the remaining cell capacity can be determined from the reconstructed OCV curve. For the investigated cell, accurate OCV reconstruction and degradation mode estimation can be obtained from C/30 partial charging curves if the state of charge (SOC) window between 20\% and 70\% is available. We show that the method is also applicable to charging curves at higher current rates if the additional overpotential is considered by subtracting a constant voltage offset. Capacity estimation with an accuracy of 2\% of the nominal capacity is possible for current rates up to approximately C/4 if partial charging curves between 10\% and 80\% SOC are used, while a maximum current rate of C/15 should be used for accurate estimation of the degradation modes.},

From these analyses, one can derive the impact of the working temperature on the battery performances over its lifetime. At elevated temperature (40°C), the performances are less compared to at 25°C. The obtained mathematical expression of the cycle life as function of the operating temperature reveals that the well-known Arrhenius law cannot be applied to derive the battery lifetime from one temperature to another. Moreover, a number of cycle life tests have been performed to illustrate the long-term capabilities of the proposed battery cells at different discharge constant current rates. The results reveal the harmful impact of high current rates on battery characteristics. On the other hand, the cycle life test at different depth of discharge levels indicates that the battery is able to perform 3221 cycles (till 80\% DoD) compared to 34,957 shallow cycles (till 20\% DoD). To investigate the cycle life capabilities of lithium iron phosphate based battery cells during fast charging, cycle life tests have been carried out at different constant charge current rates. The experimental analysis indicates that the cycle life of the battery degrades the more the charge current rate increases. From this analysis, one can conclude that the studied lithium iron based battery cells are not recommended to be charged at high current rates. This phenomenon affects the viability of ultra-fast charging systems. Finally, a cycle life model has been developed, which is able to predict the battery cycleability accurately.},

Alternating current heating is proposed as an effective preheating method to improve the poor performance of lithium-ion batteries operated at low temperatures. To describe the dynamic voltage behavior accurately, the Butler-Volmer equation has been employed, and then a novel electro-thermal coupled model has been proposed for accurately calculating the thermal behavior of a battery. To obtain the optimal preheating performance, the electro-thermal coupled model-based available heating current computational method has been developed to obtain the optimal echelon preheating strategy. This method has the potential to balance the heat generation rate and degradation on battery lifetime. Finally, the proposed echelon heating strategy has been verified by battery cells and battery packs. Results show that the battery cell can be heated from the temperature of −20.3 °C to 10.02 °C by 13.7 min with an average temperature-rise 2.21 °C/min.

	abstract = {The widespread use of lithium-ion batteries and the demand for high performance battery packs have made battery thermal modelling a crucial research area. This field helps to understand and manage the heat generated and the temperature distribution during battery operation. Effective thermal management is essential to ensure safety, extend battery lifespan and optimise efficiency. In this work, heat generation is identified as the primary driver of temperature change and distribution within the cell. Various battery models are reviewed and classified, driving the selection of the right model according to the application. Several thermal characterisation methods are described in detail, with a focus on experimental techniques that can be applied in-situ. Finally, the challenges posed by temperature distribution are discussed extensively, with a focus on how these challenges could shape the future research and design of the next generation of lithium-ion cells and battery packs.},

	abstract = {Power train electrification is promoted as a potential alternative to reduce carbon intensity of transportation. Lithium-ion batteries are found to be suitable for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and pure electric vehicles (EVs), and temperature control on lithium batteries is vital for long-term performance and durability. Unfortunately, battery thermal management (BTM) has not been paid close attention partly due to poor understanding of battery thermal behaviour. Cell performance change dramatically with temperature, but it improves with temperature if a suitable operating temperature window is sustained. This paper provides a review on two aspects that are battery thermal model development and thermal management strategies. Thermal effects of lithium-ion batteries in terms of thermal runaway and response under cold temperatures will be studied, and heat generation methods are discussed with aim of performing accurate battery thermal analysis. In addition, current BTM strategies utilised by automotive suppliers will be reviewed to identify the imposing challenges and critical gaps between research and practice. Optimising existing BTMs and exploring new technologies to mitigate battery thermal impacts are required, and efforts in prioritising BTM should be made to improve the temperature uniformity across the battery pack, prolong battery lifespan, and enhance the safety of large packs.},
