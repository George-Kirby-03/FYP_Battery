The accuracy and complexity of the ECM, hence, are very important. State of charge (SOC) and temperature are known to affect the parameters of the ECM and have been integrated into the model effectively. However, the effect of the state of health (SOH) on these parameters has not been widely investigated. Without a good understanding of the effect of SOH on ECM parameters, parameter identification would have to be done manually through calibration, which is inefficient. In this work, experiments were performed to investigate the effect of SOH on Thevenin ECM parameters, in addition to the effect of SOC and temperature. The results indicated that with decreasing SOH, the ohmic resistance and the polarization resistance increase while the polarization capacitance decreases. An empirical model was also proposed to represent the effect of SOH, SOC, and temperature on the ECM parameters. The model was then validated experimentally, yielding good results, and found to improve the accuracy of the Thevenin model significantly.

	abstract = {A lithium-ion battery cell’s electrochemical performance can be obtained through a series of standardized experiments, and the optimal operation and monitoring is performed when a model of the Li-ions is generated and adopted. With discrete-time parameter identification processes, the electrical circuit models (ECM) of the cells are derived. Over their wide range, the dual-polarization (DP) ECM is proposed to characterize two prismatic cells with different anode electrodes. In most of the studies on battery modeling, attention is paid to the accuracy comparison of the various ECMs, usually for a certain Li-ion, whereas the parameter identification methods of the ECMs are rarely compared. Hence in this work, three different approaches are performed for a certain temperature throughout the whole SoC range of the cells for two different load profiles, suitable for light- and heavy-duty electromotive applications. Analytical equations, least-square-based methods, and heuristic algorithms used for model parameterization are compared in terms of voltage accuracy, robustness, and computational time. The influence of the ECMs’ parameter variation on the voltage root mean square error (RMSE) is assessed as well with impedance spectroscopy in terms of Ohmic, internal, and total resistance comparisons. Li-ion cells are thoroughly electrically characterized and the following conclusions are drawn: (1) All methods are suitable for the modeling, giving a good agreement with the experimental data with less than 3\% max voltage relative error and 30 mV RMSE in most cases. (2) Particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is the best trade-off in terms of computational time, accuracy, and robustness. (3) Genetic algorithm (GA) lack of computational time compared to PSO and LS (4) The internal resistance behavior, investigated for the PSO, showed a positive correlation to the voltage error, depending on the chemistry and loading profile.},

	abstract = {As lithium-ion batteries become increasingly prevalent in daily life, accurately estimating their State of Health (SOH) is crucial to reduce maintenance costs and prevent accidents. Due to the high costs of measurement, data collection, and storage, traditional data-driven methods struggle to make accurate estimations in small-sample scenarios, as they rely heavily on high-quality training data. To address this issue, we propose a method for SOH estimation that embeds physical information into a neural network. First, a semi-empirical model describing battery capacity degradation is constructed based on the Logistic equation. This model is then embedded into a neural network to form a Semi-empirical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SPINN). The loss function combines the fitting error from the neural network with the error related to physical information, ensuring that the training of SPINN is guided by physical constraints. Experiments were conducted using three publicly available datasets for small-sample training. The results show that even with limited training data, the proposed method ensures accurate SOH estimation. Furthermore, comparative experiments with existing data-driven and electrochemical models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. When trained on only 50 \% of the available data, other data-driven models exhibited prediction failures, while SPINN maintained a maximum RMSPE below 5 \%.},

	abstract = {The aging mechanisms of Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-Oxide (NMC)/Graphite lithium-ion batteries are divided into stages from the beginning-of-life (BOL) to the end-of-life (EOL) of the battery. The corresponding changes in the battery performance across these stages have been analyzed, and a digital twin model is established to quantify the primary parameters that influence these aging mechanisms. Post-mortem analysis is applied to validate the results. This paper compares the aging mechanisms from BOL to EOL using two charging protocols: a multi-step fast charge protocol and a common constant-current fast charge protocol that applies the average current of multi-step currents. Notably, a transition from a linear to a non-linear degradation trend in capacity fade is observed, beginning from a 10\% capacity reduction to EOL. From BOL to 10\% degradation, the resistance of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) grows steadily. The graphite anode’s crack depth exhibits a significant increase, accompanied by an evident collapse of cathode materials in all the test cases following a 10\% degradation until EOL. This phenomenon can be attributed to one primary reason—the expansion of the corresponding simulated resistance of charge transfer (Rct). Post-mortem analysis revealed the change in morphology, structure, and composition of various degradation conditions. This analysis proved that the primary driver of the linear aging stage is the SEI growth. Furthermore, it is evident that the transition to a non-linear aging degradation is dominated by electrode defects resulting from continuous mechanical stress during long-term aging.},

	abstract = {Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing.
In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model.
This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53\% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to thermal runaway incidents at high-temperature abuse and overcharging conditions. This study employs an experimental approach that combines an accelerating rate calorimetry with a battery testing system to investigate thermal runaway behaviors in 18,650-type LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 cells at high temperatures, particularly during constant current constant voltage (CCCV) charging at rates of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C. The results reveal that cells coupled with charging behavior exhibit a greater potential for thermal runaway at high temperatures, and increased charging rates lead to increased irreversible heat and promoted side reactions, which ensure advanced thermal runaway events and enhanced heat and gas generation capacity in the cell. Furthermore, owing to the combined influences of stage of charge and the promoting effect of charging current on side reactions, the total heat and gas production and the charging rate exhibit a nonlinear relationship. Eventually, after the completion of charging, the relationship between gas generation rate and heat generation rate can be characterized by two linear growth stages. The initial stage displays consistent gas generation rates despite variations in charging rates, and the subsequent stage demonstrates different gas generation rates with increased charging rates, suggesting alterations in side reaction pathways.},

	abstract = {To reduce the carbon footprint in the transportation sector and improve overall vehicle efficiency, a large number of electric vehicles are being manufactured. This is due to the fact that environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil fuels have become significant global problems. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been distinguished themselves from alternative energy storage technologies for electric vehicles (EVs) due to superior qualities like high energy and power density, extended cycle life, and low maintenance cost to a competitive price. However, there are still certain challenges to be solved, like EV fast charging, longer lifetime, and reduced weight. For fast charging, the multi-stage constant current (MSCC) charging technique is an emerging solution to improve charging efficiency, reduce temperature rise during charging, increase charging/discharging capacities, shorten charging time, and extend the cycle life. However, there are large variations in the implementation of the number of stages, stage transition criterion, and C-rate selection for each stage. This paper provides a review of these problems by compiling information from the literature. An overview of the impact of different design parameters (number of stages, stage transition, and C-rate) that the MSCC charging techniques have had on the LIB performance and cycle life is described in detail and analyzed. The impact of design parameters on lifetime, charging efficiency, charging and discharging capacity, charging speed, and rising temperature during charging is presented, and this review provides guidelines for designing advanced fast charging strategies and determining future research gaps.},

Moreover, a detailed assessment of charging strategies is performed, based on an extensive experimental study with three different cell types. The experimental results reveal that the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on cycle life can vary markedly among different lithium-ion batteries. In general, the cycle life is influenced more by high charging currents than by high discharging currents. Different boost charging protocols have disclosed that high charging currents can deteriorate cycle life not only at high state of charge (SoC), but also at very low SoC. Our investigations on pulse charging show that lithium-ion cells withstand charging pulses of high current or high voltage without any deterioration in cycle life, when the duration of the pulses remains short and the mean current and voltage values are considerably lower. For pulses of less than 1s, cycle life has been similar for pulsed and continuous charging with the same mean charging currents and identical cycle depths. This paper also presents the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on capacity utilization, charging time, and efficiency to support the development process of optimized charging protocols for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Fast charging of batteries for electric vehicles is seen as one of the most direct ways to enhance adoption. Currently, fast charging is limited by increased cell aging, which is primarily driven by Li plating and degradation of cathode materials. Here, using combined sets of experimental and computational analysis and a suite of different charge protocols, we begin to examine the interplay between failure mode, cell designs, and ultimately aging mechanisms. Slight variation in cell design and the subsequent impacts that charge protocols have on aging can create distinct cell-to-cell variation. As little as 2\% difference in porosity change at the cell negative electrode during cycling due to early Li metal plating has been found to alter the aging pathway and either accelerate or inhibit the loss due to Li plating.},
