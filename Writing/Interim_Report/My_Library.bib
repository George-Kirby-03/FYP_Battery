	abstract = {The equivalent circuit model (ECM) is a battery model often used in the battery management system (BMS) to monitor and control lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The accuracy and complexity of the ECM, hence, are very important. State of charge (SOC) and temperature are known to affect the parameters of the ECM and have been integrated into the model effectively. However, the effect of the state of health (SOH) on these parameters has not been widely investigated. Without a good understanding of the effect of SOH on ECM parameters, parameter identification would have to be done manually through calibration, which is inefficient. In this work, experiments were performed to investigate the effect of SOH on Thevenin ECM parameters, in addition to the effect of SOC and temperature. The results indicated that with decreasing SOH, the ohmic resistance and the polarization resistance increase while the polarization capacitance decreases. An empirical model was also proposed to represent the effect of SOH, SOC, and temperature on the ECM parameters. The model was then validated experimentally, yielding good results, and found to improve the accuracy of the Thevenin model significantly. With low complexity and high accuracy, this model can be easily integrated into real-world BMS applications.},

	abstract = {Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing.
In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model.
This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53\% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.},

	abstract = {The aging mechanisms of Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt-Oxide (NMC)/Graphite lithium-ion batteries are divided into stages from the beginning-of-life (BOL) to the end-of-life (EOL) of the battery. The corresponding changes in the battery performance across these stages have been analyzed, and a digital twin model is established to quantify the primary parameters that influence these aging mechanisms. Post-mortem analysis is applied to validate the results. This paper compares the aging mechanisms from BOL to EOL using two charging protocols: a multi-step fast charge protocol and a common constant-current fast charge protocol that applies the average current of multi-step currents. Notably, a transition from a linear to a non-linear degradation trend in capacity fade is observed, beginning from a 10\% capacity reduction to EOL. From BOL to 10\% degradation, the resistance of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) grows steadily. The graphite anode’s crack depth exhibits a significant increase, accompanied by an evident collapse of cathode materials in all the test cases following a 10\% degradation until EOL. This phenomenon can be attributed to one primary reason—the expansion of the corresponding simulated resistance of charge transfer (Rct). Post-mortem analysis revealed the change in morphology, structure, and composition of various degradation conditions. This analysis proved that the primary driver of the linear aging stage is the SEI growth. Furthermore, it is evident that the transition to a non-linear aging degradation is dominated by electrode defects resulting from continuous mechanical stress during long-term aging.},

	abstract = {As lithium-ion batteries become increasingly prevalent in daily life, accurately estimating their State of Health (SOH) is crucial to reduce maintenance costs and prevent accidents. Due to the high costs of measurement, data collection, and storage, traditional data-driven methods struggle to make accurate estimations in small-sample scenarios, as they rely heavily on high-quality training data. To address this issue, we propose a method for SOH estimation that embeds physical information into a neural network. First, a semi-empirical model describing battery capacity degradation is constructed based on the Logistic equation. This model is then embedded into a neural network to form a Semi-empirical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SPINN). The loss function combines the fitting error from the neural network with the error related to physical information, ensuring that the training of SPINN is guided by physical constraints. Experiments were conducted using three publicly available datasets for small-sample training. The results show that even with limited training data, the proposed method ensures accurate SOH estimation. Furthermore, comparative experiments with existing data-driven and electrochemical models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. When trained on only 50 \% of the available data, other data-driven models exhibited prediction failures, while SPINN maintained a maximum RMSPE below 5 \%.},

	abstract = {A lithium-ion battery cell’s electrochemical performance can be obtained through a series of standardized experiments, and the optimal operation and monitoring is performed when a model of the Li-ions is generated and adopted. With discrete-time parameter identification processes, the electrical circuit models (ECM) of the cells are derived. Over their wide range, the dual-polarization (DP) ECM is proposed to characterize two prismatic cells with different anode electrodes. In most of the studies on battery modeling, attention is paid to the accuracy comparison of the various ECMs, usually for a certain Li-ion, whereas the parameter identification methods of the ECMs are rarely compared. Hence in this work, three different approaches are performed for a certain temperature throughout the whole SoC range of the cells for two different load profiles, suitable for light- and heavy-duty electromotive applications. Analytical equations, least-square-based methods, and heuristic algorithms used for model parameterization are compared in terms of voltage accuracy, robustness, and computational time. The influence of the ECMs’ parameter variation on the voltage root mean square error (RMSE) is assessed as well with impedance spectroscopy in terms of Ohmic, internal, and total resistance comparisons. Li-ion cells are thoroughly electrically characterized and the following conclusions are drawn: (1) All methods are suitable for the modeling, giving a good agreement with the experimental data with less than 3\% max voltage relative error and 30 mV RMSE in most cases. (2) Particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is the best trade-off in terms of computational time, accuracy, and robustness. (3) Genetic algorithm (GA) lack of computational time compared to PSO and LS (4) The internal resistance behavior, investigated for the PSO, showed a positive correlation to the voltage error, depending on the chemistry and loading profile.},
